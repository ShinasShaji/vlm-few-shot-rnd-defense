\note{
- The Derm7Pt dataset is a collection of dermatological images and annotations for melanoma diagnosis, as well as other skin conditions such as seborrheic keratosis, basal cell carcinoma, types of nevi, and more \\
- A seven point score of greater than or equal to 3 is to be referred for specialist analysis for melanoma \\
% - The example case shown is a melanoma metastasis case, but note that the seven point score is 1. This is a specifically challenging case, just to demonstrate the kind of examples that are present in the dataset \\
- The authors provide a python library as an interface to the dataset, and perform grouping of rare cases as well as the grouping of fine-grained categorization into more coarse categories \\
- In the authors' paper, it is shown that incorporating clinical images as input to their CNN model improves performance \\
