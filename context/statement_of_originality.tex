    \noindent I, the undersigned below, declare that this work has not previously been submitted to this or any other university and that it is, unless otherwise stated, entirely my own work. The report was, in part, written with the help of AI assistants as listed in and described in Appendix \ref{sec:appendix:ai-assistants}. I am aware that content generated by AI systems is no substitute for careful scientific work, which is why all AI-generated content has been critically reviewed by me, and I take full responsibility for it.

    % Additional information about the models and assistants used.
    % The models used locally were Llama3.1-8b-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct, Mistral Nemo, Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct
    % The models used through API were OpenAI's GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, O1, and O1-mini, and Claude's 3.5 Sonnet and Haiku.
    % Cursor's proprietary code editor and models were used for short horizon code generation and editing tasks.
